# Size Matters

## Summary

Size Matters is a game —originally created for the first GoGodotJam— where you start the game as a rock that gains conscience, progresses through the world, interacts with NPCs (choosing whether to have combat or not), eventually consuming them to grow (or choosing not to). 

Different paths lead to different endings (relatively simple): for example, if you never have combat, you might not be considered a threat by the end boss of the first level, and the game might then and there. If you choose not to consume your victims, you might squeeze through a hole that you otherwise wouldn't fit in.

## Mechanics

It works with a hybrid combat system between turn-based and real-time. Every character gets a turn counter which fills up based on character's current speed (as you grow, that number decreases). The action is determined at the beginning of the turn: players pick their next action while the current turn is underway, whereas the NPCs set their next action based on their pattern.

Every turn, the characters perform their action twice: once in the beginning, again halfway.

## 0.1 Goals

0.1 is going to be a fully-functional, 1-level-long proof of concept for the game "Size Matters". The goal is to have a POC that is as polished and satisfying as possible. As it stands, the game doesn't feel very intuitive and some people who played the game had problems with the first actions they wanted to do.

### Features

TBD.
